# PKMNEssentialsPlugin
Ruby plugin that makes rxdata managable with CVS. Outputs in YAML.

This is essentially the plugin found https://github.com/rakudayo/rmxp-plugin-system. The authors of that repo should get the credit for the majority of the code. I'm modifying it to be more friendly when using Pokemon Essentials.


Features:
- Exports both Scripts and EditorScripts to separate subfolders
- Adds an script that will allow you to export without importing first (as start_rmxp would)
